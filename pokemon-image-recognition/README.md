# A Project for CS 5232 - Intro to Machine Learning and Data Mining

This project is an image-recognition program for Pokemon. There are four algorithms being used for this project: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVG), pre-trained models, and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN). The K-NN algorithm is being generated without the use of ML libraries (besides using OpenCV to process images). These are the libraries that are required for running the following algorithms:

### cnn-algorithm.py:
pip install numpy pandas Pillow matplotlib ipython

### knn-algorithm.py:
pip3 install -U scikit-learn scipy matplotlib sentence-transformers torch

### pretrained-algorithm.py:
pip3 install sentence_transformers pillow torch matplotlib numpy pandas
